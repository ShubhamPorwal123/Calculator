# I have tried github functionalities using this repository.

1) Firstly we need to create a project either locally or on cloud ( github ) like Calculator.

2) we can create many branches from this main branch and then we can merge those branches with the main branch once we are satisfied with the changes we have made in the new branch.

3) After adding everything to the main branch, the code can be made live on the server.

This is how the branches looks like
